# Plants-Detection
This notebook demonstrates an approach to identifying plants and their structures using machine learning techniques, specifically through object detection models. The primary goal is to develop an automated pipeline for detecting and labeling plants in images, which can assist in agricultural monitoring, phenotyping, and crop management.

The workflow includes several key steps:

Introduction:

The notebook begins with an overview of the project objectives, focusing on identifying plant structures (fruits) in various growth stages. The introductory section also briefly explains the importance of plant detection in applications like precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, and plant health assessment.
Data Preparation:

A section dedicated to understanding and preparing the dataset, which may contain labeled images of plants at various stages. Images are loaded and inspected to ensure quality, and initial exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the distribution of classes (plant parts or growth stages). Data preprocessing steps include resizing, normalizing, and transforming images to prepare them for model input.
Model Selection:

CNN accuracy are highlighted to help in selecting a model that best meets the specific needs of the plant detection task.
Image Detection Pipeline:

Detailed guidance on how images are processed through the chosen model to generate bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores for each detected plant part.

Conclusion:

The notebook concludes by summarizing the insights from the plant detection model, discussing potential improvements, and noting limitations. Future work suggestions include fine-tuning the model on a larger plant-specific dataset, exploring different detection models, or integrating environmental data to enhance predictions.
